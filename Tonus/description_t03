Things are getting harder, aren't they? Binary must be named vigenere.
And your program must take two arguments: a string to decode and a key.
Your program must print usage: ./vigenere .str. .key. on the standard error stream
in case of any errors.
To decrypt the next cipher, use the keyword .brain.
