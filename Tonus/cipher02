For several centuries, this cipher resisted all attempts to break it and earned
the nickname - the indecipherable cipher.
The cipher consists of a sequence of several Caesar ciphers with different shift values.
An alphabet table called .tabula recta. or a special square table can be used for encryption.
Writer Jules Verne used the cipher to encrypt the document in his novel La Jangada.
